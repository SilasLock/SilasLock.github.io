            <h3>N64 Trigonometry: The Folded Polynomial</h3>
            <p>I've acquired some amount of internet fame for my work in assembly programming and low-level optimization.</p>

            <p>Trig functions, like sine and cosine, are used widely in games programming for important physics and graphics calculations. Computing approximations to these functions that are both</p>
            <ol>
                <li>accurate, and</li>
                <li>performant</li>
            </ol>
            <p>is a mostly solved problem on modern hardware, but for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R4200" target="_blank">some older CPUs</a> with extreme performance constraints, it poses a major challenge.</p>

            <p>After learning this was an open problem, I invented a new algorithm for computing sine and cosine approximations that achieved over <b>90 times improved accuracy</b> compared to the state of the art on the VR4300, <b>without sacrificing any performance</b>. It takes advantage of several unique features of this CPU and its instruction set architecture (e.g. branch delay slots and no branch predictor), as well as clever use of modular arithmetic.</p>
                
            <p>I then collaborated with famed N64 modder Kaze Emanuar to implement this algorithm in his new engine. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hffgNRfL1XY" target="_blank">His video</a> covers the saga in detail. If you're interested, I'd encourage you to check it out! I'm quite passionate about quality educational content, and he does a great job explaining an otherwise impenetrable topic (low level programming) to a broad audience.</p>

            <p>After this initial collaboration, I later invented an improved arctangent approximation algorithm and implemented it as well. Video forthcoming.</p>
