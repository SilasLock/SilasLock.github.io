            <h4>Hello there!</h4>

            <p>I'm a fifth-year PhD student at Northwestern University and was a visiting student researcher at Stanford University for the 2023-2024 academic year. I am advised by Professor <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/" target="_blank">Jason Hartline</a>.</p>

            <p>My primary research is in mechanism design, though my background as an undergraduate was in machine learning and economics. Somewhat idiosyncratically for someone in CS theory, I'm also knowledgeable about low-level/assembly programming.</p>

            <p>Here are some projects I've worked on:</p>

            <h3>GPU Allocation</h3>
            <p>It takes compute resources to train machine learning models, such as LLMs. An enterprise that rents costly GPUs from a cloud provider needs some way to provision them to its employees on demand, who can then use them to train models.</p>

            <p>On-demand provisioning should ideally</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Leave few rented GPUs idle, since they have already been paid for. Unprovisioned GPUs represent wasted resources that the enterprise would have preferred not to rent.</li>
                <li>Rarely prevent employees from accessing GPUs in periods of high demand. It's desirable to rent enough GPUs, or effectively ration the ones the enterprise has, to make supply constraints a non-issue.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>There is a fundamental tradeoff between these two properties. A project with Adobe Research studying that tradeoff would eventually become the basis for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19292" target="_blank">Fundamental Limits of Throughput and Availability</a>, published in <i>EC 2024</i>.</p>

            <h3>Untying Knots with Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>As an undergraduate, I did research with Professor David Bachman, a topologist at Pitzer College. We analyzed whether neural networks with custom-designed layers could correctly perturb heavily tangled polygonal knots until they became visually indistinguishable from the unknot.</p>
            
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
                <div>
                    <p style="margin: 0; padding-bottom: 5px;">In other words, our goal was to take this:</p>
                    <img src="Knot images/Lissajous Unknot pretangled.png" width="250px">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p style="margin: 0; padding-bottom: 5px;">... and untangle it into this:</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This was an interdisciplinary project that combined insights from knot theory and machine learning. The final paper can be found <a href="Linked documents/Untying Knots with Neural Nets.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            border-top: 1px solid #ccc;
            margin: 1em 0;
            padding: 0;"/>

            <h4>Other Projects</h4>
            <p>This is just a small sample of my broader research profile. I've <a href="https://github.com/SilasLock/Hilbert-Compression/wiki/Compression-Algorithm" target="_blank">invented a compression algorithm</a>, investigated the <a href="Linked documents/Are Prediction Markets Bayesian.pdf">Bayesian characteristics of prediction markets</a>, and worked on various <a href="publications.html">other interdisciplinary projects</a> between economics and computer science.</p>

            <p>I've <a href="thefoldedpolynomial.html">acquired some amount of internet fame</a> for my work in assembly programming and low-level optimization, too.</p>

            <p>If you have questions about my work or are interested in collaborating, please reach out to me via email!</p>

            <p>I am a fourth-year PhD student at Northwestern University, and will be a visiting student researcher at Stanford University for the 2023-2024 academic year. I am advised by Professor <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/" target="_blank">Jason Hartline</a>.</p>
            <p>As an undergraduate, I attended Pitzer College, double majoring in Joint Math/CS (through Harvey Mudd College) and Mathematical Economics (at Pitzer).</p>
            
            <p>I have interdisciplinary research interests between computer science and economics, and my current research is split between multidimensional mechanism design and prophet inequalities.</p> -->
