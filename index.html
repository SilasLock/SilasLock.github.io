            <h4>Hello there!</h4>

            <p>I'm a fifth-year PhD student at Northwestern University and was a visiting student researcher at Stanford University for the 2023-2024 academic year. I am advised by Professor <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/" target="_blank">Jason Hartline</a>.</p>

            <p>My primary research is in mechanism design, though my background as an undergraduate was in machine learning and economics. Somewhat idiosyncratically for someone in CS theory, I'm also knowledgeable about low-level/assembly programming.</p>

            <p>Here are some projects I've worked on:</p>

            <h3>GPU Allocation</h3>
            <p>It takes compute resources to train machine learning models, such as LLMs. An enterprise that rents costly GPUs from a cloud provider needs some way to provision them to its employees on demand, who can then use them to train models.</p>

            <p>On-demand provisioning should ideally</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Leave few rented GPUs idle, since they have already been paid for. Unprovisioned GPUs represent wasted resources that the enterprise would have preferred not to rent.</li>
                <li>Rarely prevent employees from accessing GPUs in periods of high demand. It's desirable to rent enough GPUs, or effectively ration the ones the enterprise has, to make supply constraints a non-issue.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>There is a fundamental tradeoff between these two properties. A project with Adobe Research studying that tradeoff would eventually become the basis for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19292" target="_blank">Fundamental Limits of Throughput and Availability</a>, published in <i>EC 2024</i>.</p>

            <h3>Untying Knots with Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>As an undergraduate, I did research with Professor David Bachman, a topologist at Pitzer College. We analyzed whether neural networks with custom-designed layers could correctly perturb heavily tangled polygonal knots until they became visually indistinguishable from the unknot.</p>
            
            <p>In other words, our goal was to take this:</p>

            <img src="Knot images/Lissajous Unknot pretangled.png" width="250px">

            <p>... and untangle it into this:</p>

            <img src="Knot images/Lissajous Unknot trial 3.png" width="250px">


            <p>This was an interdisciplinary project that combined insights from knot theory and machine learning. The final paper can be found <a href="Linked documents/Untying Knots with Neural Nets.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>N64 Trigonometry: The Folded Polynomial</h3>
            <p>I've acquired some amount of internet fame for my work in assembly programming and low-level optimization.</p>

            <p>Trig functions, like sine and cosine, are used widely in games programming for important physics and graphics calculations. Computing approximations to these functions that are both</p>
            <ol>
                <li>accurate, and</li>
                <li>performant</li>
            </ol>
            <p>is a mostly solved problem on modern hardware, but for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R4200" target="_blank">some older CPUs</a> with extreme performance constraints, it poses a major challenge.</p>

            <p>After learning this was an open problem, I invented a new algorithm for computing sine and cosine approximations that achieved over <b>90 times improved accuracy</b> compared to the state of the art on the VR4300, <b>without sacrificing any performance</b>. It takes advantage of several unique features of this CPU and its instruction set architecture (e.g. branch delay slots and no branch predictor), as well as clever use of modular arithmetic.</p>
                
            <p>I then collaborated with famed N64 modder Kaze Emanuar to implement this algorithm in his new engine. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hffgNRfL1XY" target="_blank">His video</a> covers the saga in detail. If you're interested, I'd encourage you to check it out! I'm quite passionate about quality educational content, and he does a great job explaining an otherwise impenetrable topic (low level programming) to a broad audience.</p>

            <p>After this initial collaboration, I later invented an improved arctangent approximation algorithm and implemented it as well. Video forthcoming.</p>

            <h4>Other Projects</h4>
            <p>This is just a small sample of my broader research profile. I've <a href="https://github.com/SilasLock/Hilbert-Compression/wiki/Compression-Algorithm" target="_blank">invented a compression algorithm</a>, investigated the <a href="Linked documents/Are Prediction Markets Bayesian.pdf">Bayesian characteristics of prediction markets</a>, and worked on other <a href="publications.html">various interdisciplinary projects</a> between economics and computer science.</p>
